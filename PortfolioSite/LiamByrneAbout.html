      <h1 class="aboutheader">About</h1>
      <p class="aboutme">Liam Byrne is a professional graphic designer located in Chicago, IL. He attended Illinois State University for four years, wherein he recieved his Bachelor of Arts in graphic design. Liam has several skills
        pertaining to the field, including motion graphics and web design. He also has many artistic interests that lie outside of design, including digital drawing/painting, music, and photography. Often times he will impliment those interests into the design work
        that he creates.</p>
				<p class="aboutme">Liam is a big believer in allowing one's own creative interests to be the strength of their design. If someone is a professional in one field but also has interests in other areas, there is nothing that should stop them from being able to impliment that creative drive and potential
				into their work.</p>
